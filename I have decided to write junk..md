- [x] Brainstorm key points and map out the structure.
- [ ] Write the post and publish it in the site.

key-points - I can't write, write one post everyday, some things I plan on writing.

##### I can't actually write but I must.
Truth be told, I can't write and learning to write will take quite a bit of time and quite a bit more effort and honestly I can't afford that as I have other important things to handle but I still need a way to express myself and thus I decided to write "junk" - write without the pressure and write absolutely anything.

I plan on writing one post every single day whether it's a well curated post or a random thought I had on a random evening, whatever it is I make the promise to myself that I will write daily atleast for a while. *Writing is honestly very freeing.*

##### What do I plan to write next?
Not entirely sure but I have some ideas, maybe I would write on the things I am working on right now such as preparing for a powerlifting competition and learning to read or maybe write posts on something I plan to do in the foreseeable future.
