First rule is to **be ruthless and lift heavy**, do not be afraid to lift a shit ton of weights but shit you can do and not ego lifting and that's where the second tip comes in, **work on your technique** - the most overlooked part of lifting heavy weights is the technique, work on your technical ability to do the movements and your numbers will go high and injuries low. The third rule is to **accumulate volume**, do not only do sets of 1-2-3 but also 5-7 every once in a while and the last rule is to **set clear goals to achieve within a timeframe** and keep yourself motivated.
