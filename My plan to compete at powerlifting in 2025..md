key-points : ridiculous goal to get a medal before my birthday, my current lifts, how do I plan on achieving my goals, why am I doing this, updates.

I have set a ridiculous goal for powerlifting, only around 4 months have passed by since I properly starting training and of course I have trained in the past too but mostly at home thus I had the base and could push through fairly easily in the start. I have decided to win a medal in the national powerlifting competition upcoming in probably the last few months of the year, which would be incredibly difficult but I am here for it.

I would need to have a total of 320-350 kg (74kg bw) to atleast qualify in the national champtionships and for any chance of getting a medal I have to hit the 400kg mark, and around 430kg for the silver and above 470kg for the gold. (remember, the numbers may vary from time to time), if anything I know then that is that this will be a tough haul and I don't even have a year left to achieve it.

Revealing my current lifts, I have a decently strong lower body and an okay upper body - 
currently I can pull 150kg on the deadlift, 110 kg on the squat and around 70kg on the bench press thus a total of 330kg. (I might qualify)

In order to achieve my goal I need a solid plan and also give a solid ammount of effort, the current split I am doing is a random mix of accessories and the main lifts and if possible I might get a solid plan suitable for me by a good coach and other than that I am mainly looking to get my numbers up by focusing on my squat and deadlift since my lower body is decently strong from the start and more muscular thus more potential but not to say I would neglect my bench press, I have to work on the technique too. 

In the following months before the competition I am looking to get my deadlift to around 190kg and a squat of 160kg and a solid bench of 100kg, will be hard but I will try my best and don't you think I should start taking creatine after all?

Till now, my whole training philosophy has been all about training really hard and pushing to the limits every workout even though recovery might be a problem at first but I should make my body adapt to training at full intensity and consistently.

Now for the legit question, why am I doing this really? 
I don't really have a solid reason as to why am I doing this but I really want to achieve this goal of mine this year, I really like doing a lot of things and being good at them - life becomes really dull otherwise and if I can manage it then I will do it. A lot of people might criticise me for not sticking to a single thing for a long-time but I simply want to do lots of different things and have the experience and the fun, if something I truly wish to do then that is to "build".

I will update on my lifting journey every once in a while.
