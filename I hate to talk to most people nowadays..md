Key-points : I don't totally understand it, everything overwhelms me, the feeling of being unwanted, connecting with fictional characters, movies & books, at the end of the day I do want to talk to someone freely, final thoughts.

It is very difficult for me to properly make anyone understand my situation, it wouldn't be wrong to say even I don't understand as to why am I the way I am but nonetheless I have accepted it.
I wouldn't be able to articulate my thoughts very well on this topic so pardon me if it is hard to understand what I mean.

Everything overwhelms me, I can't handle multiple conversations at once, I can't have any social media account once it gets a little bit too full (followers, texts ex.) - I have deleted a dozen instagram accounts till now and I don't own any at the current moment, not to mention how many times I have cleaned my discord friend list and how many times I switched accounts. I don't understand why am I like this but everything irritates me.

I can't even hold any decent conversations with the few online friends I have, I can't connect with them and soon enough everything feels forced and not to mention that no one even talks to me unless I talk to them first, I have simply given up on trying to talk to people anymore, I hate it - I have become comfortable being alone.

Not like I have much friends in real life - two friends I can connect with, I consider them  my best friends but they live not so close and most of the time they are busy and we barely talk online and I know a few more people, others might say I am friends with them but I don't consider them much, simply people I know - they don't care how I am and vice versa.

It is very true that the problem is within me but I can't help it myself, I feel like I am unwanted most of the places and besides I can't connect with anyone besides the two friends I have. But I think it's not a problem anymore, it's time I get used to it.

It has been quite a while and I almost know how to deal with the loneliness, most of the times I find comfort in the stories of fictional characters or people from the past, movies or books and even video games. I might be what you would call "the stereotypical loser" - no social life and always in the room, watching movies and into games.

But at the end of the day I do want someone to talk to freely but I am probably too cool and too smart and too handsome and too good for people to like me and to be friends with me, I know why I don't have a social life, it's because I am too good for everyone.
