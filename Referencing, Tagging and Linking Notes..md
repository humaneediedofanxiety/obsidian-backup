Basic system, create a [[Board Of Tags.|board of tags]] and put them into relevant categories, instead of using general-tags, **create tags that resonate with you** and you are likely to use more than a few times in the future.

For linking, always try to use **bi-directional linking** and link related concepts and **every once in a while, review all your notes** to see if you have missed a few connections. Create a graph of notes linking notes from all different areas.

Thirdly, use a fully [[OB Keybinds.|keyboard-driven approach]] to note-taking for better efficiency, it might take a few weeks to adapt to it but it's quite worth it, use obsidian's query to query links, tags and find notes. And for advanced querying, use the dataview plugin.
