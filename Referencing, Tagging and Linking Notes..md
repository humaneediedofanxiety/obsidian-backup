  **Tags |** #obsidian #PKM

Basic system, create a [[Board Of Tags.|board of tags]] and put them into relevant categories, instead of using general-tags, **create tags that resonate with you** and you are likely to use more than a few times in the future.

For linking, always try to use **bi-directional linking** and link related concepts and **every once in a while, review all your notes** to see if you have missed a few connections. Create a graph of notes linking notes from all different areas.

Thirdly, use a fully [[OB Keybinds.|keyboard-driven approach]] to note-taking for better efficiency, it might take a few weeks to adapt to it but it's quite worth it, use obsidian's query to query links, tags and find notes. And for advanced querying, use the dataview plugin.

Now this is for later, if you ever want to use file/folders hierarchy use this, starting with the **rough notes** where all the temporary notes reside and then **source notes** where all the notes related to books/videos/articles reside and the **main notes** where all your main notes reside, the atomic notes. There are a few other utility folders that will make organization easier, **Tags**, **Indexes**, **Templates** and **Archive.**
