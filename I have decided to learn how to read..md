Key-points : i have decided to learn to read, how much time can I allocate to this, academic texts and classic literature & fiction, the process of reading fiction, what books am I reading currently and what are the ones that I am planning to read, final thoughts.

- [ ] Allocate 30-45 minutes to writing the post and publish.

### I need to read.
I have decided to learn to read and why is that so? simply because I am dumb and also because I want to. I want to try reading fiction and academic texts mainly to increase my reading efficiency and comprehension, why fiction tho? Because it's the best thing I can think of besides academics. I have read a ton of non-fiction and self help in the past but I don't find them likable anymore but yes I mainly got into reading as a teen because of those but now I want to level up a bit and I want to do it by reading the *greats.* 

I have decided to read, Kafka, Nietchze, Dostoevsky, Camus, Satre and more.
I bought a few books a few weeks ago and here is a list of all the books I am going to read for the upcoming days (Notes from Underground, The Metamorphosis & Other Stories, Beyond Good & Evil, 1984 & The Alchemist) and I'll buy "The Princeton Guide To Mathematics".

I'll be reading both a fiction book and an academic book simultaneously to make the process of reading more fun and efficient, I will first read through physics books and "The Metamorphosis & Other Stories" & "Notes from Underground". I'll decide what to read after I finish these.

### How should I read actually?
The process of reading, for the fictions - read through the book thoroughly and without any distraction on the first read and after you are done, go through a professional analysis and breakdown of the book (find these on google) and try to understand it and finally after you are done, reread the book this time for a clearer understanding and mark certain words and sentences if you feel so. And for the academic texts, my best advice would be to read and research as you go and after every section/topic/chapter - make yourself understand using the Feynmann Technique for a more clear understanding.

How much time can I really allocate to this, for the time being - reading is my first priority and then comes powerlifting but that is only for the current month or the next, after that I have to prepare for exams so I can afford a month or so for reading and maybe 4 hours daily.

Final thoughts, I like reading and I will learn how to.
