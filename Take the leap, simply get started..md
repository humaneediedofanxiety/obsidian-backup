how the hell did I decide to create a blog all of a sudden and built it
how long it took me?
often you need to just do something simply get started and forget about the outcomes or about doing it perfectly
what do I plan to do next?

### Why the hell did I decide to create a blog all of a sudden?
Long-story short I figured out I was consuming much more and producing almost nothing, originally I wanted to have a youtube channel but ya know I don't really have the equipment and I think with my bit of coding skills I could somehow pull off a blog site and start creating content to atleast practice how-to.

The best thing is, everything started from a whim on a random thursday night and I finished it by the next evening and all of it happened simply because I decided to randomly do it and decided to start and I am proud of the final outcome, even though the actual code is absolutely crappy but as long as the site works and I can write I am content.

### Often times all you need to do is start.
You have deluded yourself into thinking that whatever that it is you need to do, you have to do perfectly and start obsessing over the final outcome even before you start, this makes it much harder to not start at all, so leave you ego behind and be open to every mistake and slips along the way of your journey.

### Whatever you start make sure you finish.
Remember one thing though, whenever you create a goal or decide to do something make sure you finish it even if the final product is not as good as your expectations, your self-esteem plays a big goal in your life and whenever you fulfil a promise to yourself (goals, tasks) your self-esteem increases and you start to reinforce your identify as someone *who achieves what they set out to do,* be careful as the opposite applies too - everytime you give up on a goal it takes a negative toll on your self-perception.

### What do I plan to do next?
Now that I have created the first post I plan to create more and soon if I can move onto more engaging content-creation "videos" and I also have started saving money to buy the equipments I need to run a youtube channel, until then let's keep writing.
