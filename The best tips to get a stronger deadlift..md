**Push your hips back:** Remember, a deadlift isn't a squat. You need to hinge at your hips, pushing them back rather than just sitting down. This keeps your center of mass over the middle of your foot. Make sure to pre-engage your hips so you can generate a strong push with your legs.

**Get closer to the ground properly:** When you lower yourself to grab the bar, do it without losing your hip hinge position. Your goal is to keep your shoulders in a good position while maintaining your balance over your midfoot. Getting this right allows you to pull heavier weights safely and effectively.

**Pull with your back AND push with your legs simultaneously:** Think of the lift as a combined action. You need to pull the bar using your back muscles while at the same time forcefully pushing the ground away with your legs. When these two actions happen together smoothly, you'll achieve the strongest and most efficient lift off the floor.
