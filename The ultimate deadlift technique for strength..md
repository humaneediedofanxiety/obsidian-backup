**The Basics**, think of the deadlift in two parts: first, a 'pull' to get everything tight, and second, a 'push' using your legs and hips. A common mistake is not getting tight enough on the pull before starting the lift.

**Nailing the Pull**, before the bar even leaves the floor, you need to pull the slack out. Keep your arms completely straight, bring the bar in close to your body, and really engage your back muscles. You'll know you're doing it right if you hear a little 'clink' as the slack comes out and maybe even see the bar bend slightly. Make sure you start from the same position every time. 

**Powering the Push** the push comes from your hips. You need to master the hip hinge â€“ think about pushing your hips back, not just bending over. An exercise like the "wall touch" drill can help you learn this. Getting the hinge right allows you to use your powerful hip muscles and takes stress off your lower back.

**Timing is Key**, the magic happens when you combine the pull and push smoothly. First, get tight all over. Then, pull the slack out of the bar. _Immediately_ after that, drive hard with your legs and hips to push the floor away. Getting this timing right makes your deadlift much stronger, more consistent, and safer.
