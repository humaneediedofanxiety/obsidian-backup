**Shoulder Position:** The correct shoulder position for bench pressing is back and down, not just back. Avoid elevating your shoulders, as this can cause stress on the joint.

**Transferring Position:** Let the bar sink your shoulders into the bench to create stability, rather than forcing the bar up. This helps maintain the desired shoulder position.

**Maintaining Position:** Keep your shoulders back and down throughout the entire repetition, both when lowering and pushing the weight. Imagine stretching your pecs like a spring while keeping your shoulders in place.

**Elbow Position:** Avoid over-tucking your elbows, as this can cause your shoulders to roll forward and disrupt joint stacking. Let your elbows follow the natural path of your wrists and shoulders.

**Warm-up:** Warm up properly before lifting heavy by doing a pyramid ramp-up, gradually increasing weight and decreasing reps. This prepares your body and allows you to refine your technique.
