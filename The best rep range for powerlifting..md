**Sets of five are beneficial for accumulating volume**, which is crucial for muscle growth, and they also aid in refining technique by allowing practice with lighter loads. **Singles, or sets of one, are most effective for improving your one-rep max** and help train your central nervous system to handle heavier weights. They also provide an opportunity to evaluate your technique with heavy loads. **Sets of three offer a balance**, facilitating both volume accumulation and CNS adaptation.

This program includes **three weekly sessions**: the first focuses on sets of five for volume at 75% of your one-rep max, the second on sets of three for heavier weight at 85% of your one-rep max, and the third on singles, starting at 90% of your one-rep max and increasing.
