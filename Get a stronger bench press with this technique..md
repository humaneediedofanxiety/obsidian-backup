 **Upper Body Setup:** It's important to keep your chest open and position your shoulder blades slightly back and down. Use your legs to push towards the upper part of the bench to get into the right position. When you're unracking the bar, make sure to maintain your upper body positioning by slightly extending your elbows.
    
**Lower Body Setup:** Think of driving your legs into the ground, as if you're doing a leg extension. Try to avoid placing your feet too far or too close to your hips. Ideally, you want to have about a 90Â° angle at your knees. Keep your butt in contact with the bench to maintain tension in your legs.
    
**Additional Tips:** Practice your setup until it feels natural. Creating a checklist can also be helpful to make sure you're consistent with your technique, add high-reps and low intensity work in routine to practice technique.
