key-points: I am a madman with ridiculous goals, why I prefer this method of super-deadlines, dozen hours of studying daily, learning system and the roadmap.

I don't know what to do anymore and I have set yet another mad goal to pursue, found a new method of doing things and I call it the "hell week" and the whole point is to basically choose an insane goal to pursue and complete over the week.

I delude myself into thinking I can do anything I can set my mind into, everything is possible - yes I indeed am very delusional but soon after I set my mind and body into a particular pursue I find out I am incapable of doing it and thus I fall into a deep ocean of despair and no that is not the bad part, on the contrary that is the good part - I find immense pleasure in the despair. I will do what I want.

What is this sudden change of mood and has my writing style changed a bit, I feel like so too but I think that is only because I haven't got any sleep yet today either and a few other things too but I cease to care simply because I write for myself and I write to myself.

May I get to the main part, I have set a goal to complete the whole physics syllabus in a week (it's the annual syllabus) - this is a mad goal and I am almost certain I won't succeed but I plan on seeing how far I can go with a dozen hours of studying and a well curated study system I had made before.

*Very bad writing and I know it and I will update on this after the week.*
