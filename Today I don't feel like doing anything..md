key-points: lyrics, last night was not the best, feeling lazy, what I will do today, my plans for tomorrow and final thoughts.

Today I don't feel like doing anything ~ 
I just wanna lay in my bed  ~
Don't feel like picking up my phone ~  
So leave a message at the tone  ~
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything~

Honestly, I am feeling really lazy today and don't wanna do anything and I am sure entirely why but maybe I can take a guess, it was probably last night - I slept early and took the pills but still I woke up in the middle of the night and goofed around till 7.

I probably wouldn't have even wrote this post if I hadn't made the promise earlier to write a post daily for a while. But I still have to do the bare minimum of things, study for 50 minutes and goto the gym and I think that's all I will do and write down all the tasks for tomorrow and maybe even figure out a way to recover and solve my lazyness.

**Final thoughts**, I feel like this every once in a while and I think it's part of life so I don't even mind it much anymore and just go on with it - accept that I am lazy and do the bare minimum (complete all the promises I made to myself) and prepare for a harsh day tomorrow. I think sometimes you need to step back a little bit and relax. *we'll meet tomorrow again.*
