**Core learning techniques**,  before starting to learn any new topic or skill create a [[The four principles of ultra-learning.|meta-learning]] map and make a dedicated list of projects accordingly, after learning a new sub-topic or concept use the [[The Feynman Technique|feynman technique]] to solidify them and create detailed summaries after every new topic or skill learnt.

**How to take action**, planning without taking action is futile so how to get started?
Choose a new topic to learn and create a meta-learning map for it, remove everything that is not essential to that specified topic and create a daily schedule and track learning hours.
