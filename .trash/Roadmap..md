[[APIs and tools]]
&: API Fundamentals
  - Understand the purpose of APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL).
  - Study HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
  - Learn about API versioning and documentation standards (e.g., Swagger).

&: Exploring API Documentation
  - Practice reading and interpreting documentation from popular APIs (e.g., GitHub, Twitter).
  - Identify required parameters, endpoints, and authentication methods.
  - Compare REST vs. GraphQL and understand when to use each.

&: Testing & Request Tools
  - Get hands-on with Postman: create collections, set up environments, and test endpoints.
  - Learn to use curl for making HTTP requests from the command line.
  - Explore automated API testing with tools like Newman.

&: Integrating Third-Party APIs
  - Build a sample project that integrates data from an external API.
  - Implement API authentication (API keys, OAuth, Bearer tokens).
  - Handle rate-limiting and pagination for large datasets.

&: Error Handling & Debugging
  - Implement robust error handling for API failures (retry logic, fallback mechanisms).
  - Log API requests and responses for debugging.
  - Use network debugging tools (Chrome DevTools, Fiddler) to trace issues.

&: Real-Time Communication & Additional Tools
  - Explore WebSockets for real-time data (using libraries like Socket.io).
  - Integrate additional services like Firebase for realtime updates or AWS for cloud functions.
  - Secure your API integrations by implementing CORS policies and rate-limiting.

&: Best Practices & Security
  - Follow industry best practices for API design and integration.
  - Secure sensitive data with encryption and proper key management.
  - Document your API integration process to ensure maintainability.
