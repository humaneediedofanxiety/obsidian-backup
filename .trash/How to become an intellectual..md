Some areas to focus on, **problem solving**, **critical-thinking**, **research & analysis** & **creativity**.
And how should I train them?

**Problem-solving**, the best way to become better at problem solving is by solving more problems and harder more complex problems. Try to solve 10 complex problems everyday in both computer science and mathematics.

**Critical-thinking**, read articles, videos or even research papers and evaluate them properly, make criticisms and agreements and form opinions on top of them and lastly write down findings and thoughts.

**Research & Analysis**, every few months, choose a topic of interest and research on it for a while and gather all your findings and conclude the research with a proper research paper suitable for publication.

**Creative thinking**, creativity is not just a trait that is guaranteed from birth but it is also a skill that can be trained using practice. Write down 10 ideas everyday or iterate of previous ones and watch your bank of ideas grow tremendously.
