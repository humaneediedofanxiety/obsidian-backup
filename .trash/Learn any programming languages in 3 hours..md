Now as always, learning a new programming language by following a 800-page book or manuals can be very daunting and to me, not so efficient. Mind you that these books and manuals can be great references. 

 And the **most efficient way to learn a programming language?** there isn't any universal perfect-approach **but there is one that really strikes me as a learner, projects.**
 Now project-based learning is the best way for me to learn a language or any technology.

 How would I approach learning a new language?
 
 Start by downloading all the essentials and setting up the development environment and then find a good [[Tons of documentations.| documentation]] for the technology, I suggest having more than one reference points incase you have trouble understanding one.

 Second up, do some research and pick up a[[Programming projects I am curious about.| project]] that you really like and curious about, now remember two things, choose a project that is not too easy or too hard but somewhere in the middle and secondly, prepare a doc for your project.

 Third, make the list of all the concepts that the project requires and learn enough of these to tackle the project, remember not to dive too deep into the rabbit hole and learn only what is necessary for the project.

And finally, make use of the all the things you have learnt and build the project, use the documentation or books to get help when stuck and remember to [[Restrict Usage of AI  | never use AI]] to debug or get help. After finishing the project, complete the doc for your project and do a final wrap-up, write down things you have to improve and next steps.
