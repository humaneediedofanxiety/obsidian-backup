## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è BENCH PRESS TECHNIQUE (Powerlifting Style)

### 1. **Setup**

- **Arch your back**: Create a stable arch ‚Äî shoulder blades pulled back & down, chest up, butt still on the bench.
    
- **Feet placement**: Tuck them under you hard. Drive through the floor like you‚Äôre leg pressing.
    
- **Grip width**: Go as wide as legal for powerlifting (index on the ring). Less range of motion = more weight.
    
- **Bar path**: Think **"J curve"** ‚Äî down to the lower chest/sternum, then back toward your eyes.
    

### 2. **Bracing & Execution**

- **Brace your core** hard like someone‚Äôs about to punch you.
    
- **Pull the bar down** with your lats, don't just lower it.
    
- **Pause on the chest**, then explode up using leg drive, tight back, and triceps.
    

### 3. **Power Hacks**

- Use wrist wraps and a belt.
    
- Pause reps in training for control.
    
- Speed work with bands or chains.
    
- Build triceps like crazy (close grip bench, dips).

## üß± SQUAT TECHNIQUE (Low-Bar for Powerlifting)

### 1. **Setup**

- **Bar placement**: Sit it just below the traps (low-bar style).
    
- **Grip**: Narrow as flexibility allows for a tight upper back.
    
- **Feet**: Shoulder-width or slightly wider, slightly pointed out.
    

### 2. **Descent & Bracing**

- Big air in belly (diaphragm) ‚Üí brace core.
    
- Break at the **hips and knees simultaneously**.
    
- Keep the **knees tracking toes**, chest up, and back tight.
    
- Squat to **just below parallel**.
    

### 3. **Ascent**

- Drive through midfoot.
    
- **Hips and shoulders rise together** (no chest collapse).
    
- Think **"push the floor apart"**.
    

### 4. **Power Hacks**

- Use lifting shoes for stability.
    
- Strengthen posterior chain (RDLs, GHRs).
    
- Do pause squats and box squats for depth and explosion.
    
- Keep elbows down to maintain upper back tension.

## ü™¶ DEADLIFT TECHNIQUE (Conventional Style)

### 1. **Setup**

- **Feet**: Hip-width apart, bar over midfoot.
    
- **Grip**: Double overhand (switch to mixed or hook grip for heavy lifts).
    
- **Hips**: Slightly above knees.
    
- **Back**: Flat or slightly arched.
    
- **Lats engaged**: Think "pull the slack out of the bar" before lifting.
    

### 2. **Execution**

- Push the floor with your legs (don't yank the bar).
    
- Bar stays close to shins/thighs the entire time.
    
- Hips and chest rise **at the same time**.
    
- Lockout with glutes, not the lower back.
    

### 3. **Power Hacks**

- Train with deficit deadlifts and block pulls.
    
- Use chalk, belt, and straps for heavy sessions.
    
- Do rows, RDLs, and shrugs to boost grip and upper back.
    
- Lats tight = bar path clean.
