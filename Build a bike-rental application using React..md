**Procedure/Roadmap**.
[[Learn the fundamentals of mobile development.]]
[[Learn firebase, real-time databases and authentication.]]
[[Create a real-time social media platform.]]
[[AI-driven development & streamline workflow.]]
[[Design the mobile application inside Figma.]]
[[Create the prototype and perform tests.]]
[[Publish the application for large-scale reviews.]]

###### Procedure : Detailed approach to building the application.

**First of all,** gain a fundamental understanding of the tools that you are going to use, react-native, firebase, typescript, MySQL, google maps, stripe.

**Secondly**, deconstruct the whole application - from all the features, file-folder structures, routine, APIs, design patterns, how everything is put together ex.

**Thirdly**, create a solid design of the whole application and become familiar with multiple AI-tools and learn about AI-driven development and how to streamline development workflow.

**Lastly**,  build the application step-by-step and do everything necessary before publishing it officially to the google play store.

**Conclusion:** building an entire mobile application without any prior experience in a single month might be a very ambitious project but with the help of proper documentation, AI tools and enough dedication I might just pull it off.
