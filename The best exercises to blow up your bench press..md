**Long Pause Bench:** Lower the bar to your chest and pause for 2-3 seconds. This builds tension for increased strength and chest mass. Perform 2-4 reps with challenging weight (80-85% of 1RM), maintaining bar stability. Good for powerlifting prep.

**Larson Press:** Bench press without using legs. This boosts upper body strength and improves bench positioning. Use lighter weights for 5-8 reps (60-75% of 1RM). Focus on good technique and shoulder retraction.

**Close Grip Bench:** Complements wide grip bench, increasing range of motion and targeting triceps. Use around 80% of your wide grip 1RM for 4-6 reps.

**Accessory Exercises:** Include dumbbell bench press to fix strength imbalances and tricep work (pushdowns, extensions) for added muscle without overdoing it. Perform with good intensity, leaving 1-2 reps in reserve.
