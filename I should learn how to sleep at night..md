key-points : horrible sleep schedule, reasons, do I really need to fix my schedule, if so then how? and do I update and if so then after how many days?

### How come I can't sleep at night.
It's 8 in the morning and I am writing this blog post simply because I can't sleep and I have nothing else to do, oh yes I am listening to music while I write too. Oh so do you think I have a very bad schedule? Yes I think so too.

I don't know how did it get so worse, sometimes I don't even sleep until the next night, sometimes I sleep for 4 and other times 14 and it's been like this for a while, of course I have tried to fix it multiple times in the past. 

### Do I really need to change it?
There is actually another question that came to my mind, do I really need to fix my schedule or can I make use of it? Let's find out then. I have had a solid schedule in the past too where I used to wake up early morning and get right to work, honestly those times had been really productive and I actually hate to work at night, most nights all I want to do is lay down and spend hours on my phone, so yes it would be optimal for me to wake up early.

### How do I plan on changing it.
Now that I have come to the conclusion that I really want to change my schedule, how come I actually do it and how long would it even take. Okay I did the thinking now let's write it into existence, first of all - take melatonin pills a hour before your intended sleep time and immediately block all distractions such as youtube and social media preferably using a scheduled app blocker and now the hard part, become consistent going to bed early untill the habit has been ingrained into your identity.

### What next?
Now to keep me accountable, I will drop another post with updates after exactly three weeks on 26th April. I will include all the techniques I tried and did I succeed at my attempt to fix my schedule and if not then why.
