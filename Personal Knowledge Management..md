1. **Easily Indexable Notes**: You want a system where you can quickly tag, categorize, and reference notes. This would likely mean a focus on meta-data (tags, links, and keywords) over a traditional file or folder hierarchy.

2. **References and Proper Tagging**: Using tags and internal references will make it easier to find and cross-reference information. This is a strong focus on interconnected notesâ€”more of a network than a rigid structure.

3. **Everything in One Vault**: Having everything in a single va\ult (instead of multiple vaults) is important for cohesion and ease of access. This aligns with the idea of one unified space for all your notes.

4. **No Folder/File Hierarchy**: Instead of organizing by folders, you'll rely on Obsidian's powerful search and index features. Tags, backlinks, and search queries will let you organize notes dynamically.
