- **Easily Indexable Notes**: You want a system where you can quickly tag, categorize, and reference notes. This would likely mean a focus on meta-data (tags, links, and keywords) over a traditional file or folder hierarchy.
    
- **References and Proper Tagging**: Using tags and internal references will make it easier to find and cross-reference information. This is a strong focus on interconnected notesâ€”more of a network than a rigid structure.
    
- **Cool Theme**: Aesthetic customization is important. You're looking for something visually appealing but not too distracting. You might want to explore some Obsidian themes or even build your own for a unique vibe.
    
- **Everything in One Vault**: Having everything in a single vault (instead of multiple vaults) is important for cohesion and ease of access. This aligns with the idea of one unified space for all your notes.
    
- **No Folder/File Hierarchy**: Instead of organizing by folders, you'll rely on Obsidian's powerful search and index features. Tags, backlinks, and search queries will let you organize notes dynamically.
