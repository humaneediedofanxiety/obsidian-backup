So there are two tips in this video on how to improve concentration, as you probably know by now that active tasks such as problem-solving, programming and others are usually easier to concentrate than passive tasks such as reading and going through lectures.

The first tip is to **make passive tasks more active**, maybe take notes or stop at points and explain a particular concept, taking notes are usually my first choice even though I don't go through them after I am done.

The second tip is to train concentration just like any other skill, **setup a timer and challenge yourself to push through it**, remember to start easy and slowly increase the timer as your concentration improves.
