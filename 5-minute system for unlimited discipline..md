This was a very insightful video, to sum up - the entirety of the video focuses on exercises to train the **prefrontal cortex** and how do we do that? the very first thing to do is gain self-respect and trust in yourself and that is by **making a small promise to yourself daily and completing it**,
secondly do the opposite, [[The Resistance List|choose a single very hard task to do everyday]] and power through it using sheer brute mental-force to strengthen your raw discipline and the last exercise is called
**urge-surfing**, that is where you train your brain to resist temptations for a while daily.
