Grip strength is often a limiting factor in deadlifts. **Using straps is not a good long-term solution**, especially for powerlifting competitions where they are forbidden.

The **mix grip technique** involves one hand overhand and the other supinated. It prevents the bar from rolling, but there's a fear of bicep tears. To avoid injury, **keep your arms straight** and avoid trying to row the barbell.

For proper grip technique, **avoid grabbing the bar too high in your hand** and squeezing too hard, as this can cause wrist flexion and bar roll. Instead, use minimal palm and grip with your fingers to prevent the bar from rolling.

Here are some exercises to improve grip strength: **heavy holds** (hold the deadlift bar at the top of your heaviest set for 5-10 seconds), **dumbbell Romanian deadlifts** (RDLs) (perform heavy RDLs without straps to improve grip endurance), and back accessories (do some sets of back exercises like rows without straps to reinforce grip).
